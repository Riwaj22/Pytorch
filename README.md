# Pytorch

PyTorch is a fully featured framework for building deep learning models, which is a type of machine learning that’s commonly used in applications like image recognition and language processing. Written in Python, it’s relatively easy for most machine learning developers to learn and use. PyTorch is distinctive for its excellent support for GPUs and its use of reverse-mode auto-differentiation, which enables computation graphs to be modified on the fly. This makes it a popular choice for fast experimentation and prototyping.
